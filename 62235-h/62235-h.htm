<p>Louisiana&rsquo;s cultural heritage dates back to approximately 10,000 B.C.
when Paleo-Indian hunters entered the region in search of Pleistocene big
game. Since that time, many other groups have settled in the area. Each
of these groups has left evidence of its presence in the archaeological
record. The Anthropological Study series published by the Department of
Culture, Recreation &amp; Tourism provides a readable account of various
activities of these cultural groups.</p>
<p>Nancy Hawkins, outreach coordinator for the Division of Archaeology,
is the author of <i>Preserving Louisiana&rsquo;s Legacy</i>, the fifth volume in
the Anthropological Study series. This volume departs somewhat from the
previous ones in the series in that it does not describe a particular group of
people or archaeological sites. Rather it addresses archaeological preservation
as a whole. In this volume Ms. Hawkins explains in general terms
how an archaeologist studies the past, what factors affect the preservation
of archaeological remains, and how government, industry, business, landowners,
and other groups and individuals can contribute to the preservation
of Louisiana&rsquo;s archaeological heritage.</p>
<p>We are pleased to be able to make <i>Preserving Louisiana&rsquo;s Legacy</i>
available and trust that the reader will enjoy this volume.</p>

CITIZENS OF LOUISIANA
</pre>
<pre class="small">
As Louisiana&rsquo;s State Historic Preservation Officer, I am pleased to introduce
<span class="u">Preserving Louisiana&rsquo;s Legacy</span>, the fifth volume in the Anthropological
Study series of the Department of Culture, Recreation &amp; Tourism and the
Louisiana Archaeological Survey &amp; Antiquities Commission.
</pre>
<pre class="small">
Through my work first in private business and more recently in local and
state government, I have become increasingly impressed with the diversity
and uniqueness of Louisiana&rsquo;s archaeological remains. There is no question
that many of these archaeological sites should be preserved for the future.
They are Louisiana&rsquo;s past.
</pre>
<pre class="small">
Louisiana has some of the most important sites in the United States. In
fact, one prehistoric archaeological site, Poverty Point in West Carroll
Parish, has been suggested for nomination to the World Heritage List.
This program, in which 45 nations participate, recognizes areas of outstanding
universal value to mankind.
</pre>
<pre class="small">
I am proud to live in a state with such a rich archaeological heritage,
and I hope that it can be protected for future generations. However, no
one individual or group working alone can preserve Louisiana&rsquo;s legacy.
Only through the concerted efforts of government, industry, business, and
individuals can this be accomplished. This volume suggests what you can
do to preserve Louisiana&rsquo;s archaeological sites. I hope you enjoy this
booklet.

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">ARCHAEOLOGY IN LOUISIANA</span></h2>
<p>People lived in Louisiana thousands of years before the first Europeans
sailed to the New World. Because of archaeology, the history of
even these early Indians is now being described and understood. All
people leave traces of their activities wherever they cook, build houses,
hold religious ceremonies, make tools, or dump their trash. If these traces
are undisturbed, archaeologists can use them to determine who left them,
when they were left, and what activities were associated with them.
These are a few of the things archaeologists have learned about Louisiana:</p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="337" />
<p class="pcap">Although many people refer to
all stone points as arrowheads, Indians
actually made projectile points
for over 10,000 years before they
ever used one on an arrow. The point
pictured here would have been used
on a spear and could have killed a
prehistoric elephant, called a mastodon.</p>
</div>

<img src="images/p02a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="485" />
<p class="pcap">In northeastern Louisiana by
1000 B.C., Indians had built rows of
earthen ridges three-quarters of a
mile across. As far as we know, they
are the earliest earthworks of their
size in North America. Some archaeologists
think they were constructed
as an astronomical observatory because
two gaps in the ridges line up
with the winter and summer solstice
sunsets.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="491" />
<p class="pcap">Contrary to present day practice,
prehistoric Louisianians preferred
marsh clams over crawfish
and crabs. They ate so many clams
that large piles of shells can still be
found in the marshes. Over time, the
shells have become compressed, and
now some piles are almost rock hard.</p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig5">

<p class="pcap">Indians in Louisiana made beautiful
and elaborate pottery without
ever using a potter&rsquo;s wheel. This delicate
water bottle was made in
northwestern Louisiana about A.D.

<p class="pcap">European missionaries and
explorers who traveled in Louisiana
in the 1600s and 1700s depended on
experienced Indian traders to supply
them with food, animal skins, salt,
and horses. In exchange, Europeans
gave the Indians beads, crucifixes,
guns, metal pots, knives, and bells
like these.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">HOW AN ARCHAEOLOGIST STUDIES THE PAST</span></h2>
<p>Although an archaeologist can gain some information from artifacts
that have been removed from a site, much more information can be
gleaned through careful survey and excavation. During a survey, the
archaeologist examines artifacts remaining on the ground and records
large concentrations as sites. The archaeologist evaluates each site&rsquo;s size
and age, and determines how it contributes to an overall understanding of
Louisiana&rsquo;s past.</p>
<p>No two sites exactly duplicate each other, but some are more unusual
than others. Some provide new or important information linking a group
of people with a certain location or activity for the first time. This means
that sometimes a small site, without elaborate or especially beautiful artifacts,
may be more important to the understanding of the past than
another site that is larger. An archaeologist who records an important site
will recommend protection or excavation for it.</p>
<p>The archaeologist will evaluate threats to the site to determine the
possibility of preserving the site intact. Some sites must be protected to
insure that future generations can see unexcavated sites, and so that
future archaeologists with improved techniques will have sites left to
study. Even if an archaeologist excavates a site, he or she will usually
leave parts of it untouched.</p>
<p>Archaeological excavation of a site is meticulous in order to preserve
every piece of information. The archaeologist photographs and draws soil
changes and artifacts as they are uncovered. This provides a permanent
record of the relationships of materials to each other and to other parts of
the site. Samples of charcoal, soil, bones, and decayed plants are collected
for laboratory analysis.</p>
<p>Long months of study and interpretation follow excavations as the
archaeologist and technicians piece together the many bits of information.
Laboratory analysis may indicate what people ate, what plants were
growing around the site, and perhaps even the date the site was used.
Study of the artifacts may tell how the site was used, who used it, and
whether they were trading with other groups.</p>
<p>Relationships of the remains show what parts of the site were used
for butchering game, cooking food, making tools, gardening, building
houses, burying the dead, and conducting ceremonial activities. Artifact
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
relationships may tell whether men and women worked in different areas,
and whether the site was used repeatedly through the years. An archaeologist
may even be able to discover very detailed information like
whether the people cooked their fish whole or in fillets, what strains of
corn they grew, and what kind of wood they used to build their houses.
This detailed understanding can result only from careful study of a well-preserved
site.</p>
<p>The archaeological sites of Louisiana span the time from the arrival of
the earliest inhabitants, approximately 12,000 years ago, to the 20th century.
These sites are as important in understanding Louisiana&rsquo;s past as
original journals from early explorers. Each is a unique description of the
land and people from years past. Just as a journal with all its pages tells
more than a single page out of context, a complete site tells many times
more than artifacts on a shelf or a site half-destroyed by modern-day
construction activities.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="513" />
<p class="pcap">Excavation of a mound site in Iberville Parish was meticulous in order to record the
relationships of materials and to collect remains for laboratory analysis (above). Archaeologists
were able to determine that under the mound was a circular house built of
cypress and ash poles that were covered with thatch (right). Inside were interior support
posts and wooden furniture such as beds or racks, as well as a central fire hearth and four
smaller fire pits. Honey locust seeds, persimmon seeds and bones from four kinds of fish
indicate some of the things these prehistoric people ate. Radiocarbon dates show that the
structure was being used at A. D. 1000.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Everyone in Louisiana has the right to know about the state&rsquo;s legacy.
The complete history of Louisiana can be recorded only through careful,
detailed excavation by individuals especially trained in archaeological
techniques. If a site is destroyed before it can be evaluated, that information
is lost forever; it is irreplaceable. Unfortunately, sites are destroyed
every day in Louisiana, both accidentally and intentionally.</p>

<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">MAJOR IMPACTS ON SITE PRESERVATION</span></h2>
<p>Throughout history, the traces of people who lived before have been
altered by those who followed. Even when Indians camped in places
where their ancestors had camped, they destroyed a piece of the record of
their past. In contrast with this age-old pattern of minor alterations,
however, is the potentially devastating impact of modern-day technology.
In Louisiana today, major types of land modification include energy exploration
and development, timber cutting, agriculture, urban expansion,
waterway modification, and transportation network construction. These
are all likely to disturb archaeological sites if they are conducted without
care.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="807" />
<p class="pcap">Heavy machinery can destroy a site in minutes.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>The country&rsquo;s need for oil, gas, coal, and timber has accelerated the
search for these products in the past decade. As exploration crews cut
roads into otherwise inaccessible areas, previously undetected sites are
exposed and disturbed. When heavy machinery is brought in to begin
logging, drilling, or mining, sites can be gouged or crushed in a few seconds.
Unless the crews are alert, fragile archaeological sites are destroyed
before they are even recorded. In Louisiana&rsquo;s coastal areas, oil and gas
production has also affected sites. Pipelines are often laid through piles of
shells because they are more stable than the surrounding land. Unfortunately,
a great many of these piles are man-made; they are actually archaeological
sites.</p>
<p>Mechanized agriculture affects sites when plows turn up artifacts,
jumbling the materials. Whenever an area is cultivated for the first time,
sites may be found. In Louisiana, previously undisturbed areas within the
river valleys are now being cleared for large-scale agriculture. Many
buried prehistoric sites along old river channels could be destroyed. Sites
in cultivated fields may be damaged further if they are plowed more
deeply than in the past. Modern subsoilers can cut three feet into the
ground, disturbing even deeply buried materials.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="484" />
<p class="pcap">This gas pipeline in southeastern Louisiana&rsquo;s marsh was laid directly through an archaeological
site.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Farmers often regard Indian mounds as troublesome when they occur
in areas otherwise ideal for plowing. If farmers do not recognize the value
of these mounds, they may have them removed. For example, a man in
Madison Parish sold the dirt from a large Indian mound on his land for
road fill. The ancient monument was removed so the land could be planted
with soybeans.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="565" />
<p class="pcap">Dirt from this mound in Madison Parish was used for a road foundation ...</p>
</div>
<p>Population growth in Louisiana has led to rapidly expanding cities
and extended transportation networks. Modern cities are often in the
same places that Indians and early Europeans built their settlements, so
city growth is almost certain to disturb archaeological sites. As early as
the turn of the century, archaeologists were charting the destruction of a
mound group in eastern Louisiana. A city was growing up around one of
the largest groups of mounds in the Southeastern United States. In 1931,
an archaeologist wrote about the leveling of one of the mounds, a square
multi-stage one, 80 feet tall and 180 feet on each side. The dirt was used to
build the approach ramps for a bridge. Today, part of only one mound
remains, protected because of the recent cemetery on top.</p>

<p class="pcap">leaving behind only a few clumps of trees.</p>
</div>
<p>The destruction mentioned above has resulted from a lack of understanding
of the importance of these sites. It has taken Louisianians a
long time to realize the uniqueness and richness of their state&rsquo;s cultural
heritage. While many people are now joining in the efforts to conserve the
remaining sites, a few continue to willfully destroy them.</p>
<p>Some individuals dig into sites in order to find artifacts that can be
sold to antiquity dealers. These looters have demolished entire Indian
villages, stealing the story of those sites from all Louisianians. Even if the
artifacts are eventually turned over to an archaeologist, most of the information
has been obliterated. Lost are the records of where the artifacts
originally came from, the relationships of the artifacts to each other, the
samples of materials for laboratory analysis, and usually the ordinary or
broken artifacts that tell the archaeologist much, but sell for little.</p>

<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">GOVERNMENT HELPS</span></h2>
<p>Although countless sites have been destroyed in Louisiana, many
other sites have been saved by concerned individuals, companies, and
organizations.</p>
<p>Our legislators have been interested enough in Louisiana&rsquo;s heritage to
draft laws that help protect sites. Without a permit, it is now illegal to dig
into, alter, or take anything from a site on state or federal land. Recent
legislation calls for strict fines or jail sentences for people collecting materials
from federal lands.</p>
<p>Our laws also help protect sites from those land alteration projects
that in the past destroyed so many sites. The locations of proposed projects
are now checked against archaeological records to be sure that no
known sites will be affected. If the project is a large one, or if the area
appears likely to have sites, an archaeological investigation will be recommended
to determine whether sites are in the area.</p>
<p>Because of this process, approximately 400 previously undocumented
sites are now recorded and evaluated by archaeologists in Louisiana each
year. This has resulted in a more complete record of Louisiana&rsquo;s archaeological
sites and a decrease in the rate of site destruction by industry.
It has also encouraged developers to think about the care of our past
early in the planning stages of their projects.</p>
<p>Both federal and state governments protect archaeological sites as
parks that the public can visit. In Louisiana, the National Park Service
has included the Big Oak Island site near New Orleans as part of Jean
Lafitte National Historical Park. This site dates from the time of Christ
and was seasonally used for shellfish collecting and processing. The Louisiana
Office of State Parks also maintains two prehistoric archaeological
sites that are open to the public and that have interpretive museums. One
is Poverty Point Commemorative Area where the state&rsquo;s largest prehistoric
earthworks were built 3,000 years ago, and the other is Marksville
State Commemorative Area where Indians built mounds approximately
2,000 years ago. Archaeological investigations have also been conducted at
many of the commemorative areas associated with 18th, 19th, and 20th
century history. These parks give people a chance to learn more about
archaeology and how it contributes to an understanding of our state&rsquo;s past.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY HELP</span></h2>
<p>Businesses and industries are most likely to deal with archaeological
sites when they plan projects on publicly-owned lands or when projects
require permits. Many developers are sensitive to the need for preservation
of important sites and plan ahead for evaluation of the project&rsquo;s impact
on these. Businesses and industries whose projects will affect sites
are proving to be creative in their responses. Sometimes, a minor change,
like moving a road 25 feet to one side, may prevent a site from being
destroyed.</p>
<p>Businesses also participate in archaeology because of curiosity about
sites on their land. Some have provided food and lodging for excavators or
have given grants to archaeologists to fund field and lab work. After
analysis is completed, these companies have either donated artifacts to a
museum or have developed small displays for their employees.</p>
<p>Companies are discovering that becoming involved with archaeology
can have tax advantages. If a company donates land with a site on it to a
nonprofit or governmental organization, the donation can be claimed as a
tax deduction. A company also can receive a tax benefit by sponsoring
excavation of a site either on or off its property. One southern Louisiana
company funded 25% of the cost of an excavation and counted that as a tax
deduction. The company owned the land with the site, so by donating the
artifacts, it also could claim their worth as a tax deduction.</p>
<p>A New Orleans development corporation planned a massive project
with an extremely important site in mind. The company leased land with a
site on it to the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park for $1.00 a year.
Rather than viewing the site as a liability, however, the company saw it as
an asset. Through the lease of the site, the corporation generated positive
community feelings, protected a part of our cultural heritage, and enhanced
the value of the surrounding property. The benefits to the community
and to the corporation will continue into the future.</p>
<p>A Baton Rouge company also was able to use archaeology in public
relations. It developed an outstanding display about prehistoric Louisiana
for the lobby of its main building. The exhibit attracts visitors and promotes
interest not only in archaeology, but also in the company&rsquo;s services.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="ss">IN BUILDING
<br />NEW ORLEANS EAST,
<br />SOME THINGS ARE MORE SACRED
<br />THAN THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR.</span></p>
<p>Once, New Orleans was rich in hidden archeological treasures.
Over 600 prehistoric sites were buried throughout the
city, but almost all of them have been destroyed in the name of
progress. One of the most valuable sites, however, has miraculously
survived the city&rsquo;s development: a prehistoric village
of the Tchefuncte Indian Tribe, dating back to 500 BC. It&rsquo;s called
Big Oak Island and it&rsquo;s located in New Orleans East.</p>
<p>In order to preserve this part of our city&rsquo;s heritage, New
Orleans East has leased this 12-acre site, right in the heart of
our community, to the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park.
The cost: one dollar a year.</p>
<p>Donating this valuable piece of land to the Park Service is
just one example of what makes us different from other developers.
Throughout New Orleans East, we&rsquo;re leaving additional
areas untouched as well, so that in the future, residents here
will have trees to enjoy, birds to watch, and parks to play in.
We&rsquo;re doing all this because we want New Orleans East to be a
community that everyone in New Orleans can be proud of.</p>
<p>Building a community with this kind of concern for the environment
may not be the most profitable development plan, but,
like the treasures of Oak Island, it may very well be priceless in
the years to come.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">PRIVATE LANDOWNERS HELP</span></h2>
<p>People who have archaeological sites on their land have many ways of
protecting the sites. A site covered by natural vegetation usually is
camouflaged and has limited access. As long as the owner does not clear
the land, disturbance to the site will be minimized. A site already in a
cultivated field probably will not suffer significantly from continued plowing
at the same depth. Although initial plowing altered artifact relationships
in the plow zone, the materials beneath remain well protected.</p>
<p>A landowner who is interested in protecting a site may want to have it
recognized by placing it on the Registry of State Cultural Resource
Landmarks. The Registry is established as an authoritative guide to the
state&rsquo;s most important archaeological sites. Once a site is placed on the
Registry, there is an agreement between the owner and the State of
Louisiana to help protect it. This process ensures that important sites will
be recognized, preserved, and protected to the maximum extent possible.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="561" />
<p class="pcap">The site in this soybean field has already been disturbed, but probably will not suffer

<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<div class="img" id="fig16">
<img src="images/p10a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="611" />
<p class="pcap">Landowners who finance excavations can receive substantial tax benefits.</p>
</div>
<p>A landowner who is unable to protect a site because of plans to plow
deeper, cultivate an unplowed area, or do construction, should alert the
Division of Archaeology. If he gives enough advance warning, an archaeologist
may be able to evaluate the site before the changes begin.</p>
<p>Recently, the tax advantages available to site owners have been
clarified. One landowner paid half of the excavation cost at a site on his
land and claimed his cost as a tax deduction. Later, he donated the artifacts
from the site and also deducted their worth, equivalent to the
entire cost of the excavation.</p>
<p>Federal tax incentives also apply to the gift of an important archaeological
site to a governmental or nonprofit organization. This donation
can be either an outright gift or an easement (in which the owner
gives up certain control of the land, but retains ownership). In either case,
the transaction qualifies as a charitable contribution for federal income
tax, estate tax, and gift tax purposes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">YOU CAN HELP</span></h2>
<p>Most archaeological sites are first discovered not by professional archaeologists,
but by ordinary people who live or work near the sites.
Usually these people do not know how to report a site to the proper
authorities. If you find a site, you can help protect Louisiana&rsquo;s heritage by
letting archaeologists know about it. The Division of Archaeology has
prepared a form especially for you to use, and one is in the center of this
booklet.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="700" />
<p class="pcap">The first step in recording a site is plotting its location on a U.S.G.S. topographic quad or
other accurate map.</p>
</div>
<p>You should fill out the form as completely as possible, without attempting
to dig in the site. Mark its location on a map, and photograph the
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
site area. Try to draw the artifacts you see; you don&rsquo;t need to be an artist,
just trace around them on a piece of paper and sketch in any designs. If
you find artifacts in a protected area where they are not being disturbed,
it is best not to collect them; they may tell an archaeologist a great deal if
they are left in place. If, however, you do collect something from the site,
be sure to store it carefully with information about exactly where you
found it.</p>
<p>Please mail the form, map, photographs, and drawings to the Division
of Archaeology. Your information will be carefully reviewed, and added to
the permanent file stored in Baton Rouge. A staff archaeologist will write
a letter, telling you if the site has been assigned an official state number,
and possibly asking for more information. By reporting a site, you will be
helping to record the history of the state.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about Louisiana archaeology, you can enroll
in a class at a local university, visit museums, read archaeology books, or
tour one of the state archaeological commemorative areas.</p>
<p>You may also want to join the Louisiana Archaeological Society
(LAS). The Society&rsquo;s chapters throughout the state have monthly meetings
with programs discussing local and state-wide archaeology. The LAS
publishes a quarterly newsletter with information about current research,
and an annual bulletin with in-depth reports. Often the LAS chapters also
are involved in archaeological survey or excavation. The organization&rsquo;s
members are both professional and avocational archaeologists who come
together to advance Louisiana archaeology.</p>
<p>You will also find other opportunities to help protect Louisiana&rsquo;s
heritage throughout the year. You can encourage your elected officials to
support legislation protecting sites. You can help friends record and preserve
sites on their land. Most importantly, you can explain to others the
importance of archaeological sites, and the reasons for preserving them. By
doing these things, you will be working with concerned people throughout
the state to preserve Louisiana&rsquo;s legacy for the future.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
